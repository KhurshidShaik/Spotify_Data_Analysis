# Spotify Data Analysis and Streaming Prediction

## Motivation
Understanding the factors that contribute to a song or album's popularity on streaming platforms like Spotify is crucial for artists and record labels. This project aims to analyze Spotify song data to uncover key attributes that influence streaming success and to predict future album popularity using machine learning techniques.

## Method and Results
This project involves extensive data analysis and predictive modeling based on Spotify song attributes, such as tempo, energy, and danceability.

Key steps include:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To identify trends and patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** To create additional variables that improve the model's predictive power.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Using various machine learning models to predict the streaming popularity of albums.

**Results:**
- **R-squared Score:** The predictive model achieved an R-squared score of **0.641**, demonstrating a strong relationship between the selected features and album popularity.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Spotipy API:** For retrieving Spotify song data.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
